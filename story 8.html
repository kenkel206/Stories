    <h1> From ex to arch nemesis</h1>
    <p>It is the first day of quinton high,Noah is just chilling on the soft beach in his school uniform the wind was blowing at his blonde hair while the sun is trying to reach his eyes which are as blue as the sea nearby his house.He checked the time on the clock  as he went to get his bag.it was 8:28.he ran out side jumped on the bus and got off and the teacher waiting at the gates glared at him but let him off then he rushed off to his first  class.As he got histim table he rushed down the hall getting lost a little but he finally reached his class sat down then looked around him.It was the wrong class he ran ut and finally found his class.he apologized and sat down where the teacher had directed him to. He was simply working and just chilling at break and lunch he got to know  his classmates and made a couple friends.as he was going to his next class a girl bumped into him and her stuff fell on the floor.
“Sorry”he said
“Its okay” the hot looking girl replied
“Noah” he introduced himself
“Ravana” the girl  replied
The girl had feroces red eyes and dark,black hair.she got her stuff and they exchanged numbers.Noah liked her and  thought she was really cute.As they carried on classes and finally finished school they went out with their friends and after dropping them off they met at a bus stop.
“It you again”Noah smirked
“Yeah so?”ravana interjected 
 They got on the bus and talked a bit.Noah had a little sister who looked like the smaller version of him but just a bit bossier.Ravana was a tom boy,never had siblings but lives near a volcano and there is a cave at the bottom of it.They talked a bit more about their lives and thought it was nice. Noah finally got off his stop and waved be with the back of his hand.Ravana ended up falling for Noah but he never talked about his parents but she never talked about hers either. She got off her stop and went straight to the volcano cave.She got her phone and was texting Noah while he was in shorts and a shirt dipping his feet in the ocean. 
“I sorta like you lol” she texted
“I really like you” he texted back
Ravana turned into a tomato.she was so happy and immediately told her friends.It ended up that every girl in the school liked him and almost every guy in the school liked her.Ravana was so shocked but left it.

They went on their first date to the theatre they watched lavagirl and sharkboy.It was great and they both liked the film.They felt bad for the characters and laughed at the villain. Ravana ate most of the large sized popcorn but it never even looked like she did with her high metabolism.
Noah thought the antagonist was a little crazy.As they were walking it started raining but they couldn't care less.They went on top of a building admiring the street lights like they were stars below.
“It looks pretty”ravana said
“Yeah,guess so”wondered Noah
 Ravana fell asleep on Noah's shoulder so Noah bridal carried her to her house and put her in bed. 

A couple months later the decided to make their relationship public.guys end up being jealous of Noah and girls being jealous of Ravana.They don`t care and have had their big dispute a while ago  over each others space.Ravana always wants to be around Noah but he wants  to chill with his friends.In the end  Ravana lost and Noah got to hang with his friends.Ravana just got pouty.

Noah went to parkour with his friends being the fastest out of all of them.Ravana decided to go running being really fast at 49 kilometers per hour, one off from Noah.They are both the fastest and most agile in there year that's why they are really good at sports and mainly liked it.As Ravan made a turn she saw Noah jump to the next building.He didn't know she did parkour when she was younger.Ravana went ahead while Noah was waiting for his friends.She started doing parkour and Noah as confused to check who was confront of them.As noah went to meet up with the girl who came from nowhere he was dumbfounded finding his girlfriend parkouring with his friends.
His friends were so jealous finding out Noah's girl  could parkour.Noah left his friends head-to-head with his girlfriend. They kept on going till the school.after the had reached school they had gone to the chip shop. 


They ate and talked and laughed at the stupid stuff till really dark late in the night.Ravana slept on Noahs shoulder.Noah laughed softly and decided to carry her over her shoulder home being to tired himself.When noah reached home he was really tired and not being able to have the energy to go back hoe he slept over at his girls house,luckily her mom was ok with it. Since it was too late for Noah to go back home by himself.As he saw her sleep so perfectly he fell asleep himself.the night was very short but he really liked being able to protect her at night.


Ravana woke up and was suddenly back at home.as she was heading for breakfast.Noah was already going home to quickly get in his uniform and go to school.they made eye contact and smiled at each other softly.Noah caught the bus to go home and could not stop thinking how cute ravana was when she fell asleep.he got off at his house and ran all the up his room leaving the keys in the door.he got changed,brushed his teeth and ran back outside with his backpack on and biting on bread as he was putting his keys in his pocket.he got the bus on time and jumped on.unfortunately the bus broke down on the way so he decided  to parkour the rest of the way to school.Luckily he made it on time.he later regretted the bus breaking down because he had double science with the same rude teacher.

He suddenly got moved up,Miss Novana was his teacher,she was pretty  and young.people thought noah was related to her even though her posture and thought process was very much like ravana.he used to like her a little but was weirdly creeped that she somewhat reminded him of his mum.He ended up being fond of her.while Ravana was in a different class. 
Ravana was better at science than Noah. She was always 2nd in her year, always been like that for most of her life, 2nd  at math, 2nd at pe when the prettiest girl in year 11 left she was so happy to be first.she always tried her best.as the teacher talked she drifted off thinking about how she got here.she lived with her mum and her dad left when she was young she doesn't remember much about him.her mom worked all day everyday and wouldn't be home till late;raana would usually make herself dinner watch tv and get ready for bed.as her mom was a workaholic.she never got time to spend with her.



Science was finally over, it was about time.Noah went to see ravana the talked for a bit and went to there next lesson.it was break and they were having a great time;the were jumping on the roofs of the school teachers told them to get down but the refused after the whistle blows they got down safely ready for the next  lesson. After school they chilled together all of a sudden there was a full blown fight between ravana and noah. Ravana accused Noah for cheating on her. Noah said he was with his friends at the time but Ravana didn't believe him.one of Ravana`s fans wanted to go out with her but they hated Noah the photo was edited and then they broke up. 


Ravan ran into the caveat the bottom of the  volcano,she started crying.all of a sudden a dark bug flew in.it   had a cloak.
“Do not worry we shall make him pay”
“Really?”ravana hoped
“Yes,i shall train you to defeat him”
“Where do i sign”she ured
“With you blood”
Ravana with no hesitation gave her blood to the strange being.suddenly a mountain of bugs came and bowed down to her.Ravana not aware of what she had done was smirking to get back at her ex boyfriend. 

Meanwhile Noah was going for  a swim. He dived into the ocean relaxing underwater.in the distance he saw a king like figue come close and then he was right in front of him.Noah could not believe it...Poseidon was right in front of him;God of the sea.

“Do not fear my child you have a duty to do because it must be fulfilled ”the mighty seaman announced

“Me duty pls i can` even do my homework”he said as poseidon gave him the ability to talk underwater
“Homework this isn't school the world is in danger”poseidon boiled
Boom!Noah swam back up seeing destruction everywhere. There was only darkness even though Noah came back from school an hour ago.There was blankets of lava covering everywhere and sprouts of fire in easily flammable places.Noah was petrified all of a sudden he was grabbed down back and two hand grabbed his head with a thumb in the center of his forehead and another at the top of his head.he felt a rush of power flow inside and was  filling up.he wanted to vomit it out but  he had to keep it  down,he burped.

Noah was confused he found out Poseidon was real and not some fairytale. He went to one of his friends' houses,Jacob. He went in soaking wet.they draped a towel around him.As he went to sit down stunned trying to calm down from what happened. He  had the god of the sea  tell him he had to save the world.jacob sat next to him after he was dry.Noah knew  what he had to to save the world.He started training for a couple of days.he wouldn't eat just train and train  til he felt tough enough.

Noah worked on his newfound powers so he was prepared for what he had to fight in his trouble.Noah could now control watar to the highest rate.ice mid rate and  low air. He kept training for another two weeks and started eating his greens, proteins and anything to help him get stronger.He went to active volcanoes covering himself with a  water barrier.The was strong enough to go to carry a country of people.He went to the rocky areas near his home and was able to make the thickest of walls collapse. Finally he was ready to fight the monster he did not know what it was.


As he went on his journey there was a craftsmen shop.Noah remembered that he needed protection.As he went in the were the rarest of swords and the strongest of gear they were so powerful.The old man was at the counter was jolly even though the world was literally ending.
“I wouldn't choose that young warrior  if i was you”The wise man said
“Why not?”asked Noah
“No matter how prepared you are it's your heart should be” said the retired warrior
Noah was taken in and trained by general  Aizawa.He gave him a strict schedule to follow and laid traps From a small trip line to fire blasters.He kept training for 5 months.He was finally ready for the exams.

It was very normal for people to be gifted help usually servants of gods but it was super rare to be gifted powers by a god only 1% in the world can.meetings with gods directly is also very rare only a couple people in the world have seen God's directly.The general explained as his best friend used to talk to them.

Noah was finally getting the grasp on all the training that he had abs of steel.Muscles so tough they looked like rocks.As he was finally ready he got the weapons and gear to help him.he got the sword of odin and scythe of Ares,shield of athena.He was ready for battle. There were no more problems the world was going to be restored like how it was.

Noah went outside,thee was lava everywhere but buildings were lava poof so everyone could not leave.noah with his lava resistant armour walked towards the girl who caused the mess.Noah was frozen in shock,his mind stated racing,why did his ex girlfriend so mad about not being able to be with him.As soon as she looked in noah's direction fire was hurtling towards him.luckily he made a water explosion before it  hit the the forty year old man in the bathroom.The poor old guy was staring in shock as his life flashed before his eyes only taking a dump.The lava turned to ash as the water bubble swallowed it.Noah made a tidal wave that avoided all the houses.The lava sublimed and the  watar did not touch a single house.The lava tuned into rock.Ravana`s fist teleported centimeters away from Noah's face but he swiftly dodged it.He encapsulated Ravana and she fought with all her might but he was stronger.She stopped moving like a floating like she was dead.


Noah breathed finally won,as he was putting his guard down.Ravana was full of life.a huge explosion of lava broke out.Ravana had given her soul away for power.Noah was sad for her,he kept on fighting.The monster fought not thinking of anyone in danger,people had to be evacuated by the police,firefighters while noah  put a ice barrier up.Once everyone was evacuated Noah could fight using his full power.he completely flooded the area and froze it on the spot.it was draining a lot of his power that  his hair started to change colour.

The monster was freezing while Noah was  perfectly fine.It tried to fight but Ravana`s fire was not helping it fight.Noah walked up to ravana as the monster retreated out of her. He saw her eyes were back to normal holding her face with one hand,Noah  kissed Ravana.  

“The picture was fake”noah said
“It was?”Ravana confused 
“Yeah”replied Noah
Ravana started crying, realising the damage she had done.She didn't know what to do,Noah knew they couldn't give back the powers given to them.Noah decided the will finish school and help emergency services,

“I am going to work in the fire force”announced Noah
“I am going to help poorer people low class countries.”announced Ravana

After they graduated that’s exactly what they did.Ravana helped with countries that were flooded.while Noah was a fireman.They saved people’s lives and supernaturals are finally normal with 60% of the world having supernatural powers.Noah and Ravana are married with 3 children.Joyful,fruitful and complete.
