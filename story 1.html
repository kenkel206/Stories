    <h1>A world beyond the black hole</h1>
    <p>In a neighbourhood darkest at night these were 3 teenagers Justin,Amber and Luke.Justin was doing home work in his pjs and jet black scruffy hair.Amber was sleeping her blue eyes were closed and her blond hair was everywhere.Luke was awake working on his jet pack with his ginger hair going mad and blue eyes sore.all of a sudden a bang went over the neighbour hood at 3am. There was a tornado and a black hole when the teens looked out the window a huge tornado picked them up like nothing they got thrown at the black hole. 

 

They woke up in another world they stared at each other in utter silence.they screamed for half an hour then ran for help but no one was in sight they were in a world the did not know a place science didn’t even set foot on these young ones where the only ones left. 

They kept walking and walking and found a village when they went to the first house they saw and knocked on the door an old lady opened it. 

 

“Excuse me but do you know how we can get home”asked Justin worriedly. 

“The answer you seek is inside of you”responded the old lady mysteriously. 

the 3 teens looked at each other confused and worried.they thanked the lady and carried on with their journey as they saw a shop they walked in. 

The cashier said "welcome to planet black hole buy things you need for your adventure” 

The teens looked around :one found gear, another found ingredients, and the last found a boat the paid with the money that came out from nowhere and were off.the travels in the boat they travels to see what was going on.they reached an island. There was no other signs of life as far as they could see.there were trees of all kinds tall,short,saplings, full grown and a sand deeper in the forest.
