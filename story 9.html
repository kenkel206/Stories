    <h1>Half bully half innocent</h1>
    <p>Nicole is a school bully, she hangs out with the cool kids and makes others feel bad about themselves. She has family issues too, her dad left her when she was 5, her mom works 5 jobs every day and trying to keep her safe. Nicole keeps acting rich so she doesn`t get bullied when she takes the bus home she gets off the stop before her house so people don't make fun of her small,old-looking apartment. Her mum is still at work so Nicole does homework, scroll through photos and makes herself dinner. Her mum arrives at 1:00 am every night so Nicole is in her king-size bed, the last thing she remembers getting from her father. She was in burnt oak talking to her mum about her life, unfortunately, one of her classmates at school recorded her talking about it and posted it online. when Nicole noticed she cried in her bedroom and wouldn`t go to school for 2 weeks.she had an idea so she got her neighbor Jack and told him everything. Jack is a hacker and a software developer so he hacked the social media sites and got the video and replaced them with an online bullying video. Nicole was so joyful, she went back to school as if nothing ever happened and forgot about all bad of her past.
