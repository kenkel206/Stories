    <h1>Music saviours</h1>
    <p>Nerephrita was checking for high demon energy, it was in the town centre of tokyo as she went towards the beast.singing a spell, she saw a light skin guy is already fighting the beast,from the corner of her eye.his sniper having it distracted. Nerephrita finishes off the incarnation destroying the low powered monster.The man dived towards  her.
“Well Done,I am Ququi”The man introduced himself.
“I am Nerephrita”Nere said.
They talked for a while Ququi`s a street  guitarist while Nere is a witch. Ququi was very calm about it and thought it was cool.Nere was gathering a band together.Hei was hesitant as he looked into Nere`s huge purple eyes but he soon accepted to join.

They started talking about themselves,Nerephrita was living in a small village,she was rejected in the village as she was a witch,she had a mentor who would teach her spell from a old dusty sell book.The mentor taught her every spell except one on the very last page,she wondered why and why she couldn't access that spell.The spell was known to be forbidden but for all her life till she listen but when she was eighteen she decided to see the spell.She did the incantation as soon as she she let a drop of her blood fall on to the circle,a swarm of demons came out and she had ran away with the village been  taken over her mentor stayed and tried to  fight them off as Nere ran away with only the spell book in her bag and wanted to eradicate all demons off of earth.

 Ququi learned guitar when he was a child and fell in love with it.A new girl joined the guitar club so he decided to help her they would always partner up in songs and thought it was really cool.The girl sadly got depressed and Ququi was gonna tell her he had a crush on the girl.But when he went to go to to their meet up place on the canyon he saw her fell as he saw a huge dark shadow on her back.

“Wait!”he shouted
She died.

They gave her a burial service and memorial. Ququi became a teacher for a couple months before becoming a street guitarist.and now he was  a guitarist in a band.but what will help.

He decided to but it was gonna be hard,Nere and him were gonna be street performers or the time being. They defeated any monsters they saw and would be trying to save anyone while doing small gigs and performances.

While they were performing a drummer was also wanting to perform so she set up next to them and got into the rhythm as they just let  the punk girl do  what she wanted and ended up pulling a very good crowd and as they finished their performance they started talking.All of a sudden a low-mid tier demon come out of nowhere and its tail was thick and strong with its full canine blood-stained teeth.the punk girl was holding an mechanic bow in her hands and as she released the bow it struck in the beast right in the middle of forehead then Nere put a chain spell on it with Ququi finished it off with a bullet going through the arrow and right in the middle of the beasts brain immediately collapsing and turning to dust.
The punk girl who was with them was called Fia she had a normal family life but then when she was going out with her brother but when he was really excited to go to the park and as the park was at the other side of the road.Her Brother lunged forward to get to the park but a car out of nowhere came and hit him.She could never forgive herself for her brothers death.The driver was a drunk driver and had his girlfriend or a long time leave her.Her father left and it was only her mother and her.Fia used drumming and archery to get though.

They finally defeated the beast heavily breathing.The finally won the huge battle so to celebrate they went to a restaurant  on the coast.They collapsed at the door and caught their breath. A blonde man helped them as they got to sit down. He saw her purple eyes and his heart started pounding.He went whenever she needed something and Quiqui could tell so the blonde came again.
“What's your name?”asked Quiqui
“Sorrel”the man respond
“Can you cook?”he asked 
“Yes”sorrel said
“Can you fight”The punk girl asked 
“Yes,i am a swordsman”responded sorrel
“Come with us”said Quiqui

The problem was sorrel loved to join but the restaurant was his home after his parents died.They were millionaires but were filled with greed,he was very giving having to give the poor money but since they were always hungry he wanted to make food.The Chef of the house was cleaning up late but when he heard young Sorrels footsteps he found out the child was doing something good so he taught him how to cook and then he would make sure his parents found out.One day his parents found out unfortunately they were very angry a sorrel and made sure he never went out o his room at night the cook was also fired.But at that same night both parent had got very ill.They were rushed to the hospital. Unfortunately they were  already dead.
Sorrel got to inherit all their stuff at a young age of twelve the cook decided to become his guardian and built a restaurant with their house behind it and lived there ever since.

Sorrel joined and  Fia also introduced herself but never talked about her past at all with the band.
As the four of them were looking out for more demons while putting on performances from time to time they put on a small performance with enough money but as the crowd cleared away they saw a 16-year-old girl crying.


The girl had a flute and a bag with a book of spells.Nere was surprised at first but then realised.
“Are u a summoner”she asked softly
“Yes”The shy girl whispered.
“What's wrong?”Nere wondering
“My village is in chaos and its all my fault”said the young girl.

The girls name is Callese.She lived in small village.Her parents abandoned her so she would try get whatever ood she could find.There were cute pets he would see and she would want one for her own.She was neglected in her village or being useless and not having a guardian but one man took her in he taught her summoning technics and she got to summon cute animals other beasts but there was only one rule Callese had to follow.She could never do the spell one the last page of the spell book.he alway wondered why but the geezer would never tell her.One day she was tired of not getting what she wanted so Callese did the spell but thousands of demons came out and ravaged the village people started dying let and right and screams were at the whole village.Her mentor told her to run away with the book and flute while he stayed to fight off the vile  creatures.Callese ran and didn't look back scared to see what she did to her village.she ended up in the town.

As the girl finished explaining everyone looked at each other and decided they were all going back to see if anything is ok and the possibility to save some lives.Callese led them back to the  village and their were about a hundred or so still in the village.They fought as many as they could finishing clearing up the village and fixing it up.then Callase saw the old man one the floor.

“Gramps!!”she ran crying 
“Stupid girl i told u to not come back”master roshi scolded
“Lets us help and you”callese cried
“No its is now my time”
“please ,i beg”
“I see u found some friends”
“gramp stop”
“In the darkest times look at the light because  the light will always be there when things seem to be the worst”he said as he died.

Callese started crying and everyone stayed silent,no one knew what to say they felt very bad and then Quiqui wondered where ithier home was.Callaese told him and he started digging with a shovel he found nearby and digged an average  whole to fit a human.The went carrying the old man's empty shell and put it in the grave as the covered it.Callese summoned rare crystal roses and put it on the grave. They went and left the village like it never happened.

Nerephrita and everyone else carried on defeating the monsters as well as made trackers of their energy.The defeat ones  small as newborns to as large as giants.Getting stronger and tougher as time went on.They were gonna fight one of the largest demons in the entire world,The Anorax.The beast was so powerful it could take down the entire of Europe.The beast was the Democratic republic of congo.as it has a very strong and powerful tail and teeth lie dagger with claws that make knives seem blunt.The beast was not one to mess with or you would be a breakfast bar.

The ferocious beast was giving endless,pain,grief and sadness out to all the citizens in the country.They had barely any water supply and the rich people of their country were full of so much greed the would even let them sit in parts of the streets.the leader was corrupt and gave very high tax that many people could not afford.That built up on a lot of causing the demon to rule over the country without anyone paying full attention.The team urging themselves to try help out the country as it was the last since they cleared out the rest of the world weakening the demon already.Quiqui and Fia were one the sides being long distance fighters.Callese kept it in one place summoning lions to pin it down.Sorrel went on to the demons neck trying to cut its thick neck and Nephrite aimed her index and middle to its forehead.the spoke the spell and then released it and then as the beast was going out of control everyone else shot it and beheaded it finally defeating the monster.

Nerephrita head started to spin  and then thud! She had collapsed as Sorrel ran and picked her up and they went to the nearest hospital.Her eyes started to open looking around she saw sorrel seated next to her.everyone else was around her worried.

“You guys”she said as a tier rolled down her face.no cared for her lie that before.
They talked for a while, relieved that she was ok as she was able to walk around like nothing happened.everyone decided go see if she could get discharged but they wouldn't let sorrel go as they knew how he was like around Nere.It was only him and Nere together.his heart started to pound realising what his friends had done to him.

“Nere”he said softly
 “Yes”she beamed with a smile
“When i first saw you,my world lit up”he smiled to himself
“Huh”Nere was not understanding
“ I‘ll have this”his body took over he couldn't control himself anymore he kissed her. 

Nerephrita just stood there turning into a tomato and couldn’t understand why Sorrel kissed her,what made him like her.She always thought he was a good friend but all that happened is really confusing.She decided to think what made Sorrel like her.

Well when nerephrita was discharged the all went out to get ice cream to celebrate then decided to crash at a  hotel and squeeze practice for the final bosses.The did aim,strength,and power training before they went to bed and early in the morning.They decided to go look at the sunrise together.As they finished training the headed to the dark zone.


The ran towards the dark zone.Aphrodite was there she was an older,wrinklier,uglier version of Nerephrita.
“Are so u decided to finally give mother a visit dear”the sinister witch said.
“No..No you can’t be”Nerephrita was overwhelmed and couldn’t believe it her mom was the master witch.

Everyone was shocked at the finding but then Sorrel was angry.very angry.he charged towards her with his katana and hit something it was an invisible barrier her was angry.Quiqui was able to shoot the scrawny woman in the leg therefore causing the barrier to close and Sorrel to slice the woman with all her might.

“Love is really a nuisance”she said annoyed as she died.

The team’s victory was cut shortly because a man with a skeleton head red skin,beafy.he had armour and a sword in his monkey hand.

“You killed Aphrodite...so you shall pay with ur lives”his low booming voice announced.
