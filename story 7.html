    <h1>Draft</h1>
    <p>In a dark gloomy town there are a bunch of buildings and very few street lights on twitching in the middle of town. A school that is old and hasn't been renovated in years part coming off slowly as kids live there till there an adult. There is a grey Dome shape lab next to the school where babies are made.Woman are not aloud or they will get a death trial since. The last non-controlled race died out. People now follow an entire schedule of the government.The government is right and does what they say.”the government knows”people say to remind themselves the only way to make the decisions is how the government thinks of it.babies give people joy when they meet them so only people from the government handle them and give them numbers well child 1049 escaped as the government mis its every move a lady finds the baby and thinks about what todo.It is dark and gloomy and cold what should happen?Should it be given back,taken in,helped,forgotten,alone,is it even?
