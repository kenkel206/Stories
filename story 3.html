    <h1>Brothers 'til the end</h1>
    <p>Lesly and Jamain have been together for almost all their lives Lesley is 2 years older than Jamain and they are internet famous, Jamain used to work on Imagination tv but he got fired.Lesley is very athletic, he was on crazy exercise and beat it quite smoothly, They did become greedy once but it was youtube that did that. There was a competition for siblings that whichever sibling win get $100 million each. Lesley and Jamain Patterson were ready for it so they signed up.

It was the day of the competition and it involved KCI and Benji and the Dolsan twins.There was a  ninja warrior course with a slip side next to it for the weaker sibling.KCI and Benji struggled when it came to the sibling special talent.Lesly and Jamain acted a comedy show and the Dolsan twins read each other's mind, it was a draw.The last level was who knew who the best so the Patterson brothers won.


They won the prize money and were so happy they ran all the way home to celebrate with friends and family.
