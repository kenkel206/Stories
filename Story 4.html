        His had  auburn hair was messy and skinny body had marks .
         His honey eyes and felt like crying all the time. His mum was busy working  and his dad would tell him to be a man.
          Charles was tired so he went to the gym every day after school for 3 years doing weights and boxing. 
          He was so strong his bullies ran away.(he had huge muscles and he was 69 inches tall)
            Charles was so athletic he got into all the sports teams.His best was tennis and they won all the games. 
            He ended up getting all the girls but he was still very smart and became  the only smart guy in both looks and knowledge.
             After a few years later he ended up graduating and his ex bullies had to redo all their tests.
